- 👋 Hi, I’m @Guto-xavier. I'm 21 years old I’m majoring in physics at UFRGS. Became self-taught by my curiosity and love for teaching and solving problems. I am always studying something and can’t imagine myself without studies and research.
- 👀 I’m a huge enthusiast of science and tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, java, japonese and improve my english.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything! I'm new on tech so I don't know exactly what I want to study.
